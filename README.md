# Godot 4 - Simple RPG

I have been following the [DevWorm](https://www.youtube.com/@dev-worm) tutorial series, "[How to Create an RPG in Godot 4](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3cGrGHvkwn0zoGLoGorwvGj6dHCjLaGd)" on Youtube, and have decided to modify the code to make it more challenging for myself.

## What is the project about?

My plan is to consolidate what I have learned from other tutorials by incorporating the concepts into this project. While I don't have the drive to create a game from scratch, I intend to follow the tutorial and improve upon it.

I hope to create something that resembles a final game while adding small challenges along the way.

## How do I plan to achieve my goal?

1. I will watch every video in the tutorial series.
2. For each video, I will implement the same functionality or similar functionality.
3. I will modify the code, project structure (folders, scripts, scenes, composition, and more).
4. For each video, I will create a separate branch, and the main branch will always have all the changes.

## The Goal

My ultimate goal is to have fun while learning and practicing what I have learned.
